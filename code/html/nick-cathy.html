  wind. my first year on the ucidb would not be the same without you. it's funny
  how we both have mutual friends in sf even though they're people that i've met
  when i was like 10 LOL you're one of the kindest people i've ever met and you
  truly deserve everything good in the world ! thank you for hanging out with me
  and for watching the tv version of high school musical even though everyone kinda
  craps on it but we know their playlist is kinda fire xD ( we still haven't caught
  up on it sadly ) i hope you enjoy your 21st birthday with friends n family, have a
  good one (':
