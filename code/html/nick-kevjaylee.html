  about 3 years since I met you when you were a freshie first year. I'm so thankful
  that you applied to AMP where we shared many memories and growth together. Even
  after AMP, we still made time to catch up and have fun times, so if anything I
  hope we can have more of that as you enter... your... last year already... Thanks
  for being like a lil bro to me and I'm so excited to see the great things that life
  has in store for you! You are always so hardworking and know how to keep a positive
