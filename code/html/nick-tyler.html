  HAPPY FUCKING LEGAL 21 BIRTHDAY BITCH!  You finally made it and can now officially
  be designated as the adult of the house.  We can finally buy soju at zion when
  we go grocery shopping together omg 😭😭😭.  Despite the circumstances, I really
  wish you have a good one mai dude you deserve it.  When all of this calms down,
  you know what's gonna happen?  I'mma be legal as well (kekekekekke) and we can
  finally join in on those DTF runs that all the 14th gen oldies go to randomly
  during the school year.  IT'S FINALLY TIME TO JOIN THE 21+ CHAT!!!  It's been
  a real long journey thinking back on it and it's still weird to remember how I
  met you on that Anteater Express bus thinking you were a complete fuccboi that
  was friends with Carlson Jin 🤢.  But from having study seshes at your dorm study
  room, randomly getting Anteatery meals, then actually becoming roommates with you
  and Ivan, and finally becoming water coaches these are times that I will really
  never forget and will cherish with me.  I may not be the type of person to be very expressive to show appreciation a lot, but I really will miss the time we spent living together after we graduate and will feel like a lil part of life is missing when I can't just randomly show you an Instagram meme at any time or have you bait me into playing a valorant/smash/brawl stars/league game.  In the end tho (lul sidetracked a bit),  happy birthday man, hope you enjoy what's to come huehuehue 😁😚🤩!  PS.  we still have yet to take a picture with just us two at a rave LMAOOO
  (PSx2 we rlly need to take more photos together LOL)
