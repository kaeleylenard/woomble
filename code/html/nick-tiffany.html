  <p class = "message">
  Thanks for being the best partner ever this year on board. It was honestly really
  fun to get to work with you for DBOTs and even closer through being coaches
  together on board. I honestly didn't see myself working with anyone else but
  you as coaches for Fire. I always appreciated how thoughtful you are and how
  crazy your work ethic is. It's also kind of crazy how we knew each other since
  freshman year of high school but never really talked LOL. But I'm so glad I got
  to know you much better now, and I have so much respect for how hard you work in
  all aspects of your life, whether it's in DB, professionally, or even for the
  people you care about. Enjoy your 21st cause you deserve it!!!
